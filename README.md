# Modul 323: Functional Programming

Welcome to the repository for my ICT Module 323 project. This codebase demonstrates the practical application of functional programming paradigms, focusing on writing clean, robust, and side_effect_free code.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to solve challenges using a declarative approach. Instead of traditional imperative loops and mutable state, this solution utilizes:

* **Immutability:** Data structures are not modified in place; new states are created and returned.
* **Pure Functions:** Methods rely solely on their inputs and produce consistent outputs without altering global state.
* **Higher Order Functions:** Functions are treated as first_class citizens, allowing for flexible and reusable logic.

## Features

This application includes the following capabilities:

* **Data Processing:** Efficient handling of data streams using functional pipelines.
* **Error Handling:** Management of edge cases without relying on traditional exception throwing where possible.
* **Modular Design:** Small, single purpose functions that can be easily tested and composed.

## Usage

To run this project locally, clone the repository and execute the main entry point:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Snackrunner11/modul-323-projekt.git](https://github.com/Snackrunner11/modul-323-projekt.git)
