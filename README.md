# Modul 323: Functional Programming

Welcome to the repository for my ICT Module 323 project. This codebase demonstrates the practical application of functional programming paradigms, focusing on writing clean, robust, and side_effect_free code.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to solve algorithmic challenges using a declarative approach. Instead of traditional imperative loops and mutable state, this solution utilizes:

* **Immutability:** Data structures are not modified in place; new states are created and returned.
* **Pure Functions:** Methods rely solely on their inputs and produce consistent outputs without altering global state.
* **Higher Order Functions:** Functions are treated as first_class citizens, allowing for flexible and reusable logic (e.g., using map, filter, reduce).

## 🚀 Features

This application includes the following capabilities:

* **Data Processing:** Efficient handling of data streams using functional pipelines.
* **Error Handling:** Robust management of edge cases without relying on traditional exception throwing where possible.
* **Modular Design:** Small, single_purpose functions that can be easily tested and composed.

## 🛠 Technologies

The project is built using strict functional standards:

* **Language:** [Insert Language e.g., Java / Python]
* **Version:** [Insert Version]
* **Tools:** [Insert Tools]
